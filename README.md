### Introduction
 As a current full-time student who started studying at the beginning of this year
 learning through e-learning I have dedicated myself to gaining knowledge in key
 cybersecurity areas that I’ve highlighted in my CV including Python, SQL, NIST security
 frameworks and network security. I’ve completed several online courses provided by
 EC-Council, Google and CISCO. I actively participate in hacking academies hosted by
 TryHackMe and Hack the Box. Through these online study resources, I have had the
 opportunity to build an active portfolio showcased on my personal GitHub and gain and
 understanding of cybersecurity fundamentals.
