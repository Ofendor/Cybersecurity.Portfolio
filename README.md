<p style="font-size: 13px;">
  Hello everyone and welcome to my Cybersecurity profile. My name is Emilio, and I'm based in Aotearoa, New Zealand. Here, I aim to showcase my journey as a Cybersecurity student.
</p>
<p style="font-size: 13px;">
  As proof, I have included numerous portfolio activities that will track my hands-on work with Kali Linux, Python, SQL and database management, data packet sniffing and analysis, generating reports following security frameworks and compliances like NIST, and many other security tasks. I also actively participate in hacking academies/hubs hosted by TryHackMe and Hack the Box. 
</p>
<p style="font-size: 13px;">
  Through these portfolios, showcased on my personal GitHub page, I've been able to get a deeper understanding of cybersecurity fundamentals. This profile will be updated from time to time to show my latest projects and learnings. You can also get a copy of my CV and further information about my career below.

<p style="font-size: 13px;">
  As a future Cybersecurity professional, I understand that continuous learning is key to developing a strong cybersecurity mindset. My ultimate goals are:
</p>
<ul style="font-size: 12px;">
  <li>Be fluent in Python and SQL to better automate cybersecurity tasks.</li>
  <li>Learn more about Kali Linux for key security duties.</li>
  <li>Acquire an internationally recognized certification like CompTIA CySA+ and Cisco CCST.</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-size: 13px;">
  My journey as a Cybersecurity student has led me to be interested in joining a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst or a future Pentester.
