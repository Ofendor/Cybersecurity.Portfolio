### INTRODUCTION
Kia Ora koutou! Hello everyone and welcome to my Cybersecurity profile. My name is Emilio (AKA Milo) and im from Aotearoa, New Zealand.
- Here, I aim to showcase my journey as a Cyber Security student. As a proof, i have included numerous portfolio activities that highlight my hands-on with Kali Linux, Python, SQL and database management, Data packet sniffing, and reporting following compliances like NIST and many other security  frameworks, and many other tasks. 
- I'm exited to share that i've completed several courses provided by EC-Council, Google and CISCO. I also actively participate in hacking academies/ hubs hosted by TryHackMe and Hack the Box. 
- Through these online study resources, Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to build an active portfolio, showcased on my personal GitHub page, and gain a deeper understanding of cybersecurity fundamentals. As a future Cybersecurity professional, I understand that continuous learning is key to developing a strong cybersecurity mindset. This profile will be updated from time to time to showcase my latest jobs.
